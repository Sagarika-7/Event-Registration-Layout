# Event-Registration-Layout
This project presents a complete  Event Registration  Layout designed to simplify the workflow of event 
organizers and enhance the user experience for participants. The system allows users to register for an event 
by entering their personal details, selecting event type, venue, duration, and number of attendees. A  dynamic 
real-time  cost calculation module instantly computes total payable amounts based on user selections.
A key feature of this system is the integration of UPI-based digital payments using an automatically 
generated QR code built through  QRCode.js. The QR updates instantly whenever the event details or payable amount changes, ensuring accurate and seamless payment processing. The system also supports multiple 
payment methods, including UPI, credit card, debit card, and cash on delivery.
Upon successful registration and submission of the form, the system generates a  digital receipt with all event 
and participant details, which the user can download. Additionally, an  Admin Dashboard displays all 
registered users’details, including personal information, event selections, total cost, and timestamp—allowing efficient tracking and event management.
Overall, this project demonstrates a clean, user-friendly, and responsive interface combined with automated 
calculations, QR generation, and detailed dashboards, making it a complete and functional solution for modern event management requirements.

#Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and develop an automated Event Registration  Layout that 
simplifies and streamlines the entire registration workflow. The system aims to eliminate manual form filling, 
reduce human errors, and ensure accurate data collection through proper input validation.Another important 
objective is to implement dynamic cost calculation so that the total amount is automatically updated based on 
event details such as venue, duration, and number of attendees. The project also focuses on integrating a secure and instant UPI payment system by generating a real-time QR code whenever payment-related parameters 
change.Additionally, the system aims to provide users with a downloadable digital receipt after successful
